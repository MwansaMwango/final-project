## Motivation
CCTV has been the goto solution to prevent employee or internal theft. Business managers can't be present at all times and are too busy to review hours of video footage. Employee theft continues to hinder profit margins for business owners, especially in most eveloping countries with average annual income is under US$ 3,000!

## Solution 
BizzWatch is a solution that leverages computer vision and data analytics to detect, audit and predict revenue or customer demand.
